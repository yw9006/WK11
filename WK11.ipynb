    "3\\. The cost function (called `loss` here) is the `L2` distance between all price predictions and all actual prices in our dataset calculated in one go. It's a single number we can take the derivative of. We could skip the square root, but this way our units stay consistent and error is calculated in terms of standard deviations.\n",

    "4\\. The parameters we are optimizing and updating at each iteration aren't our features, but the weights and thresholds of each of our $6$ neurons, which have `requires_grad` turned on by default. At each step we update the model's parameters with `p.data.sub_(p.grad.data * learning_rate)`. This is the very bureaucratic form of doing something like: `p -= p * lr`. Since we are dealing with parameter tensors that keep all kinds of extra information about their values, we have to operate on their `data` members.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Once we have used the parameters' gradients to update our model we have to clear them by calling `grad.zero_()`. We'll see why soon, but by default if we are reusing the same tensors (in this case our model's parameters) we have to make sure they don't accumulate gradients."
