Small steps, on the other hand, take a little longer to find the objective, but usually converge on the correct value.\n",

    "3\\. The cost function (called `loss` here) is the `L2` distance between all price predictions and all actual prices in our dataset calculated in one go. It's a single number we can take the derivative of. We could skip the square root, but this way our units stay consistent and error is calculated in terms of standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The parameters we are optimizing and updating at each iteration aren't our features, but the weights and thresholds of each of our $6$ neurons, which have `requires_grad` turned on by default. At each step we update the model's parameters with `p.data.sub_(p.grad.data * learning_rate)`. This is the very bureaucratic form of doing something like: `p -= p * lr`. Since we are dealing with parameter tensors that keep all kinds of extra information about their values, we have to operate on their `data` members.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\\. Once we have used the parameters' gradients to update our model we have to clear them by calling `grad.zero_()`. We'll see why soon, but by default if we are reusing the same tensors (in this case our model's parameters) we have to make sure they don't accumulate gradients."

Gradient descent is the official name of the algorithm that calculates which way to update our parameters given the slope of our cost function and a learning rate. _Stochastic_ means that it should still work if we sub-sample our input data and only use a subset of the data points at a time. It remembers/accumulates information about previous error measurements.\n",
